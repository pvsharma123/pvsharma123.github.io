                <p>
                    Our problem is that users have found it difficult to find specific food items in stores or
                    <br>restaurants during certain times of the year. For example, it is challenging to find pumpkin bread
                    <br>outside of the fall season because many stores do not have it. Our solution will provide users a
                    <br>quide to locating their favorite consumables no matter the season.
